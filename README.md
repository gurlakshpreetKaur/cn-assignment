## Features
* The entire project has been made using only Tailwind CSS for styles.
* The ID card is created using data fetched from random user API.
* The user can be randomized using a 'randomize user' button available on a top nav.
* The website's theme can be toggled between day-mode and night-mode using a switch.
* The ID card is responsive, and on small screens, the profile image appears at the top and the user information follows (below it rather than side-by-side).
